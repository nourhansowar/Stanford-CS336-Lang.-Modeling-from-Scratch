# Stanford-CS336-Lang.-Modeling-from-Scratch

This repository contains my **personal implementations and solutions** for the assignments in **Stanford CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch**.

The goal of this project is to **deeply understand modern language models by building all components from first principles**, without relying on high‑level deep learning abstractions.

I will **continuously update this repository** as I complete assignments and experiments throughout the course.
